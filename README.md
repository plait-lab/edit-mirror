# [UNDER CONSTRUCTION] Edit Mirror

Edit Mirror is a suite of tools to log Elm programmers' edits to their code over
time.

We are currently running a research study using Edit Mirror to gather
fine-grained information about programmers' behavior.

If you're interested in participating, **please take a look at our
[e-flyer](TODO)!** We welcome new participants of all experience levels.
