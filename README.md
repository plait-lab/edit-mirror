# Edit Mirror

Edit Mirror is a suite of tools to log programmers' edits to their code over
time.

We are currently running a research study in which participants install this
plugin so that we can gather fine-grained information about their programming
behavior.

If you're interested in participating, please take a look at our
[e-flyer](TODO)! We welcome new participants of all experience levels!
